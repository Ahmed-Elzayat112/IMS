# Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **System Analysis and Design** course. The primary objective was to transform a manual inventory management system into a digital solution to enhance efficiency and provide data analysis capabilities.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main phases: **Analysis** and **Design**.

### Phase 1: Analysis
In this phase, we focused on understanding the system requirements and defining the following:
- **System Need**: The necessity for digitizing the manual inventory process.
- **System Value**: The benefits and improvements expected from the new system.
- **Objectives**: Specific goals to be achieved by the system.
- **Functional Requirements**: Features and functions the system must have.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: System performance and quality attributes.

### Phase 2: Design
In the design phase, we created various diagrams to represent the system architecture and workflows:
- **Use Case Diagram**: Illustrates the interactions between users and the system.
- **Block Diagram**: Shows the system components and their relationships.
- **Flowchart**: Depicts the flow of processes within the system.
- **Context Diagram**: Provides an overview of the system and its external interactions.
- **Data Flow Diagram**: Represents the flow of data within the system.
- **Class Diagram**: Describes the structure of the system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, and relationships.
- **Sequence Diagram**: Details the sequence of messages exchanged among the system's components.

## Tools Used
We utilized several tools for creating the diagrams:
- **Draw.io**
- **EdrawMax**
- **Lucidchart**
- **Software Ideas Modeler**

## Acknowledgements
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to **Dr. Basma Mostafa** for her continuous support and guidance throughout the project. ‚ù§Ô∏è
